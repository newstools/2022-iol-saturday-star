Johannesburg - The Embassy of Palestine successfully hosted the Free Palestine Football Tournament at the Iya Alexandra Stadium this weekend, with support and participation by the community. The tournament was held with the cooperation of the Department of International Relations and Cooperation, the Department of Sport, Arts, Culture and Recreation as well as the United Nations on Sunday. Representing the Embassy of Palestine, Consulate-General Hassona Aldramly said he was overwhelmed by the community’s support and participation. “I used to play football as a young man growing up in Palestine. The child in me is fond of the unity and growth that comes from youth sharing their passion with their peers in celebration of a bigger goal.” The champions from Alexandra will go on to face champions from the Cape Town leg of the tournament, and the winning team will fly to face Palestinian champions of the same age group. The event was part of the Embassy’s participation in youth development programmes to uplift the youth of South Africa, as well as part of the International Day of Solidarity With The People of Palestine commemorations and encourages solidarity through sport. This event significantly echoes the unwavering support for a free Palestine that South African democracy’s founding president Nelson Mandela lamented.  The Saturday Star
