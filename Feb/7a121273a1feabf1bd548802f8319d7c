Johannesburg - The Embassy of the State of Palestine will on Saturday hold the Free Palestine Football Tournament at Iya Alexandra Stadium. This is in cooperation with the Department of International Relations and Cooperation, the Department of Sport, Arts, Culture and Recreation as well as the United Nations. The event will be held as part of the Embassy’s participation in youth development programmes to uplift the youth of South Africa, as well as part of the International Day of Solidarity With The People of Palestine commemorations, and encourages solidarity through sport! This event significantly echoes the unwavering support for a free Palestine that South African democracy’s founding president Nelson Mandela lamented. Today,  nine years since his passing,  Nelson Mandela remains a symbol of hope for a better future for Palestinians - a future that is void of racism, interrogation, abuse and division. Show your support for youth development and solidarity for Palestine by popping in at the tournament this weekend. For registration and further information, contact Hassona Aldaramy on 073 686 3443.
