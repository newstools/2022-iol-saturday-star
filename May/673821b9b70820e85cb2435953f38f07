Johannesburg - As a precautionary measure, Shoprite and Checkers have announced that they are initiating a voluntary recall of 170g cans of Cape Point Light Meat Shredded Tuna in Water. The retail giants said that this was due to the possibility of cans having defective double seams. “To date, we have not received any complaints. This action is being taken out of an abundance of caution,” they said. Shoprite and Checkers explained that the voluntary recall is limited to products with the following production code: EEJCK BPHGS01. (The production date is 23/07/2021 and the best before date is 23/07/2024). “Cape Point Light Meat Shredded Tuna in Water products in 170g cans with different product codes from the one listed here are not affected by this recall, and neither are any other Cape Point products.” To locate the production code, consumers should look on the bottom of the can. The retailers added that consumers who may have purchased the product listed above should not consume it, but instead return it to their nearest Shoprite or Checkers store for a full refund. “Kindly consult a medical professional for advice and guidance if you have any concerns after consuming the affected product.” Shoprite and Checkers said that they were working closely with and would continue to co-operate with the National Consumer Commission on the voluntary recall. “The quality and safety of our products are the top priority for our business,” they said. “We understand that customers will be concerned and apologise unreservedly for any concern and inconvenience caused by this voluntary recall.” If you require any assistance with finding the production code or returning a product, contact 0800 01 07 09 or email consumerc@shoprite.co.za / consumer@shoprite.co.za The Saturday Star
