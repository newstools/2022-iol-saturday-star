Johannesburg - KFC South Africa is literally putting its money where its mouth is, with its bold ‘taste guarantee promise. The fast food giant announced this week that if a customer’s meal is not 100% ‘Finger Lickin’ Good,’ it will swap it. “This is not only a first for the Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) industry, but is also testament to KFC’s commitment to serve only the very best fried chicken, freshly prepared so that every customer experience is a great one,” KFC South Africa managing director Thuthuka Nxumalo explained. A lot of work has been going on behind the scenes at KFC to ensure that the fast food outlet provides the best meals possible, she said. “Our original recipe and 11 herbs and spices is famous throughout the world, and recently our team of over 35 000 people have gone through more than 60 000 hours of re-training to ensure only the very best quality chicken is served, every day, every time,”  Grant Macpherson, marketing director at KFC South Africa added. “In fact, we are so confident in our amazing taste, that we are guaranteeing it.”  KFC Africa chief operating officer Thuthuka Nxumalo said the company was leaving ‘no drumstick un-breaded’ and only using the freshest ingredients that were meticulously monitored and controlled. It was also using technology and processes that met the highest food service excellence standards, in addition to the ongoing training, upskilling, and auditing of its restaurant team members and operations, Nxumalo added. “We are confident we are serving great food, with great taste every time. But if for some reason we don’t, well that’s not good enough and we’ll gladly replace it.” The Saturday Star
