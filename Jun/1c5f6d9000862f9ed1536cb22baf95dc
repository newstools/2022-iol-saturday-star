Johannesburg - The latest round of loadshedding this week continues to wreak play havoc on the nation’s people’s lives and livelihoods.   On Friday, Eskom announced that due to the ongoing unprotected labour action, the utility was compelled to take precautionary actions to conserve emergency generation reserves.  As a result, South Africans can now expect Stage 4 loadshedding from 5am until midnight this weekend.  This week, The Saturday Star visited some of Johannesburg’s residents to see how the latest rounds of power cuts have affected their lives. This includes youngster Simphiwe Ndlozi from Pimville, Soweto who has been struggling to do his homework because of load shedding. He is now forced to do so by candle light when the power is off. Also in Pimville, a shop owner said that he is unable to sell meat because the power cuts causes it to get spoiled.  And fellow entrepreneur Zodwa Ndlozi who has a cooking business has been severely affected by loadshedding as she has to now spend money on gas which she can not afford. The Saturday Star
