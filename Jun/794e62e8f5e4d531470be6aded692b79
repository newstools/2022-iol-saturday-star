Johannesburg - A new theatrical variant is about to open at Sandton’s Theatre on the Square – LOCKED UPSIDE DOWN… AND INSIDE OUT!  Daphne Kuhn is proud to announce a sequel to the musical comedy revue, with a touch of the original, LOCKED UPSIDE DOWN, which enjoyed capacity audiences earlier this year. The gorgeous, talented women are back and boosted with more songs and new stories to share. The new productions will open on the June 22 and run for three weeks, until July 9. LOCKED UPSIDE DOWN … AND INSIDE OUT should be a welcome theatrical tonic for the challenging lockdown period we endured.  The performance is conceived by and features Sharon Spiegel-Wagner and Lorri Strauss, and introduces musical director and pianist, Elizabeth Lemmer. It is directed and co-written by the esteemed Alan Swerdlow. LOCKED UPSIDE DOWN…. AND INSIDE OUT  explores the trials and tribulations of two mothers, their friendship and wacky antics as they confront the devastating Covid pandemic during lockdown and beyond. Kuhn says: “We are inviting our very loyal and supportive audience back to Theatre on the Square, to experience again, the joy of stimulating, relevant and entertaining live theatre and music.” We have no doubt that LOCKED UPSIDE DOWN… AND INSIDE OUT will be a special night out, filled with an abundance of laughter, tears and memories. Through songs and stories, audiences will be tapping their feet to reimagined and familiar theatre songs. The production team hopes to fill hearts with music, warmth, hope and healing.
