Johannesburg - In an act of resistance and commitment to the people of South Africa, and in Solidarity with the plight of Palestinians, political  party Al Jama-ah erected a statue of former Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in front of Joburg City council office. Al Jama-ah also declared the City of Joburg as an apartheid free zone. This follows the party turning down the Democratic Alliance's (DA) request for three votes in Joburg, based on the party's support for Israel. “The DA in the City of Joburg has demonstrated the true nature and purpose of its existence. This nature,” Thapelo Amad, Al Jama-ah Gauteng Provincial Chairperson said in a statement.“ “It is evident in their proximity with the apartheid state of Israel.” Amad reiterated that the plight of the Palestinian people is evidence of a modern form of apartheid. He called upon all political parties represented in Joburg City Council to reject the status quo, as defined by the DA for the residents. “We equally pay tribute to a revolutionary leader, Yasser Arafat, and affirm our solidarity with the people of Palestine.” Palestinian Ambassador to South Africa, Hanan Jarrar expressed gratitude on behalf of Palestine for the unwavering support and consistent Solidarity by Al Jama-ah. Two weeks ago the party's leader, Ganief Hendricks, said he had met with the DA federal council chairperson Helen Zille, who asked for the party’s three votes in Joburg ahead of upcoming crucial council sittings. “Zille said she did not want to go to the EFF on her knees, begging for their votes. The DA supports Israel, and that is against what we stand for,” said Hendricks. “Al Jama-ah supports the people of Western Sahara and Palestinians…I told Zille that the DA’s support for Israel is a support for apartheid.” The Saturday Star
